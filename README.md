My inspiration for this game initially came from the tabletop game Lazers & Feelings created by John Harper. 
The inclusion of a dice mechanic was a particularly important feature for me to include being an avid fan of tabletop rpgs and the various dice systems they employ.

The story and creature concept are inspired heavily by the Alien franchise.

## Getting started

You can play the game by following now by following this link: [HEXtract Deploy link](https://sk-yates.github.io/hextract-adventure-game/)

Instructions are included in the start-screen of the game, but to clarify while you're here... 
#### How to play
HEXtract is an incredibly simple game to playthrough. Simply follow these steps:
- Press the start new game to begin your sci-fi survival adventure.
- For each node in the story, you'll be presented with a series of buttons to choose your next action. 
- After each selection the game will roll the die for you and with a roll of 3 or higher you succeed!
- However, should the die roll result be lower than a 3 your action fails and results in the death of a crew member.
- You begin the game with a crew of 5 members but you only need 1 crew member to survive to win.
- Can you complete the mission and get out alive? Why not give it a try?


## Planning

During the planning phase of this project, my main focus was on having the selection and die mechanic work in tandem to add an extra dimension to the choose your own adventure structure.

I began by researching various choose your own adventure game building methods and once I was comfortable with the approach found in this project, I began by experimenting with various methods of intergrating the dice rolling mechanic into the player's game progression.

Once I'd established the basis for the game's main mechanics (choosing options and alterning the path based on the dice roll), the next step was to include the lives system (represented in game by your crew members). This inclusion was intended to add a real sense of stakes to the game as the player isn't simply following a branching story. Through this mechanic, you could reach a game over at virtually any point in the story (with a few exceptions). 

The next step was finally putting all the pieces together, which has been a particularly difficult endeavour at times. Throughout the project there have been multiple issues encountered from story nodes data inconsistencies to sliced and diced together code to ensure key features work.

## Next steps

If I were to continue developing this project there are a number of features I would love to incorporate into furture iterations: 
- The inclusion of an interactive map of the ship that would allow players to further visualise their journey through the story.

- Following the map inclusion, an updating marker to show the player their position on the ship.

- Following the previous two inclusions, having players able to select points on the map to move from room to room to trigger elements of the story would be the next stretch goal for the project. 

- Once these improvements are added and players are able to visualise the game setting to a higher degree. I'd love to continue developing the story futher, adding more branches, more options and even including game state changes to allow players to collect and use items in story choices.
